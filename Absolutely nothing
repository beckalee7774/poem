Once on a yellow piece of paper with green lines
he wrote a poem
And he called it 'Chops'
because that was the name of his dog
And that's what it was all about
And his teacher gave him an A
And a gold star
And his mother hung it on the kitchen door
and read it to his aunts 
That was the year that Father Tracy 
took all the kids to the zoo
